## <a name="overview">Overview</a>


This package contains the tools to validate and score the TA1 evaluation tasks: ND (norm discovery), ED (emotion detection), VD (valence diarization), AD (arousal diarization), CD (change detection) and scoring tools for the Hidden Norms (NDMAP). Please refer to the CCU Evaluation Plan for more information about CCU, the evaluation tasks, and the file formats.

This README file describes the reference annotation validation tool, system output validation tool, scoring tool, reference statistics computing tool and random submission generation tool.

 - Reference Validation Tool: confirms that a reference annotation set follows the LDC CCU annotation package directory structure.
 - System Output Validation Tool: confirms that a submission of system output follows the rules set in the CCU Evaluation Plan.
 - Scoring Tool: scores a system output submission against a reference with a scoring index file.
 - Reference Statistics Computing Tool: computes basic statistics on the reference data for the ND or ED task.
 - Random Submission Generation Tool: generates a random submission for the ND or ED task.


## <a name="setup">Setup</a>

The tools mentioned above are included as a Python package. They can be run under a shell terminal and have been confirmed to work under OS X and Ubuntu.

### <a name="installation">Installation</a>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/ccu_validation_scoring

cd ./CCU_validation_scoring

python3 -m pip install -e ./
```

## <a name="format">Directory Structure and File Format</a>
The CCU validation and scoring toolkit expects input directories and/or files to have specific structures and formats. This section gives more information on these structures and formats that are referred in subsequent sections. 

The `reference directory` mentioned validation and scoring sections must follow the LDC annotation data package directory structure and at a minimum must contain the following files in the given directory structure to pass validation:

```bash
<reference_directory>/
     ./data/
          norms.tab
          emotions.tab
          valence_arousal.tab
          changepoint.tab
     ./docs/
          segments.tab
          file_info.tab
     ./index_files/
          <DATASET>.system_input.index.tab
```

where `<DATASET>` is the name of dataset.

Please refer to the LDC CCU annotation data package `README` for the formats of the above `.tab`
files. 

The toolkit includes several sample reference datasets for testing. See `ccu_validation_scoring/test/reference/LDC_reference_sample` or other sibling directories.

The toolkit uses different index files for various purposes:

* `system input index file` - tells the scorer which files are available for the system to process. This file is included in the CCU source data package and is used in validation and generation of a sample submission. The format is described in the CCU Evaluation Plan.
* `system output index file` - tells the scorer which files were processed by the system. This file is generated by the users and is used in validation and scoring. It must be located inside the `submission directory`. The format is described in the CCU Evaluation Plan.
* `scoring index file` - tells the scorer which files to score to facilitate subset scoring. This file is generated by the users and is used in scoring. The `scoring index file` has one column with the header `file_id` containing file IDs to score, one per row.

An example of a `system input index file` can be found in the sample reference datasets:
```bash
ccu_validation_scoring/test/reference/LDC_reference_sample/index_files/LC1-SimulatedMiniEvalP1.20220909.system_input.index.tab
```

An example of a `system output index file` can be found in the sample submissions:
```bash
ccu_validation_scoring/test/pass_submissions/pass_submissions_LDC_
reference_sample/ED/CCU_P1_TA1_ED_NIST_mini-eval1_20220816_050236/system_output.index.tab
```

## <a name="usage">Usage</a>

In the `CCU_validation_scoring-x.x.x/` directory, run the following to get the version and usage:

```bash
CCU_scoring version

```
CCU_scoring is an umbrella tool that has several subcommands, each with its own set of command line options.  To get a list of subcommands, execute:

```bash
CCU_scoring -h
```

Use the `-h` flag on the subcommand to get the subcommand help manual. For example:

```bash
CCU_scoring score-nd -h
```

### Reference Validation Subcommand

**Validate a reference annotation directory** to make sure the `reference directory` have the required files.

```bash
CCU_scoring validate-ref -ref <reference_directory>
```

**Required Arguments**

 * `-ref`: reference directory

```bash
# an example of reference validation
CCU_scoring validate-ref -ref test/reference/LDC_reference_sample
```

### Submission Validation Subcommands

Each evaluation task has a subcommand to validate a system output file.  The evaluation tasks include Norm Discovery (ND), Emotion Detection (ED), Valence Diarization (VD), Arousal Diarization (AD), and Change Detection (CD).  Use the subcommands below to **validate the format of a ND/ED/VD/AD/CD submission directory** against a `reference directory`. The `submission directory` must include a `system output index file`. 

```bash
CCU_scoring validate-nd -s <submission_directory> -ref <reference_directory>
CCU_scoring validate-ed -s <submission_directory> -ref <reference_directory> 
CCU_scoring validate-vd -s <submission_directory> -ref <reference_directory>

-ref test/reference/LDC_reference_sample
```

**Norm Discovery Mapping Validation**

Use the command below to **validate the format of an NDMAP submission directory** with a `hidden norm list`.  This validation only applies to the mapping file, not the original system. The `hidden norm list` has one column (no header) containing norm IDs, one per row.
