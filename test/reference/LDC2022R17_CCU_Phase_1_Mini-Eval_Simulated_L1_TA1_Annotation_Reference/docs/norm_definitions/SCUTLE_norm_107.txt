ID 107: Doing finalizing negotiation/agreement/deal
Definition of Norm Category 
Doing finalizing a negotiation/agreement/deal is indicating that an outcome of a conversation is agreed-upon and/or settled. It could involve both formal negotiations and deals and informal agreement on a topic of discussion. Examples could range from agreement on the terms of a contract to the sale of a new car to the decision of where to eat dinner.

This norm frequently occurs at the end of an interaction as a negotiation/agreement/deal is drawing to a close. Instances of this norm could also happen multiple times during a conversation if something were a multi-stage negotiation for example or a group of people agreeing on multiple sections of a contract or a group agreeing on different topics such as terms, price, plan of execution, etc.

This norm could involve a variety of verbal and non-verbal clues. Verbal clues that this norm is happening could involve a summary statement of what has been agreed upon and verbal acknowledgement of the terms of the deal. Non-verbal clues that this norm is happening could be the nod of a head, a handshake or bow, or the signing of some type of paperwork. 

This norm sometimes precedes a leave-taking norm, but it should not be mistaken for a leave-taking norm. A leave-taking norm does not reference the topic of the negotiation/agreement/deal but rather is a general ending to an entire interaction. Finalizing a negotiation/agreement/deal is focused on the specific topic of that discussion. It also does not include any leave-taking formulas such as ?goodbye? or ?see you later? or indications of departure such as getting up to depart from a conversation or a wave goodbye.
